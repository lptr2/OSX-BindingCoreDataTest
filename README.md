XCode 7.3: Using binding capabilities with CoreData to fill and edit NSTableView

This is a minimalistic Swift test project that does just 'some' code (line 21 & 22 in AppDelegate.swift) to sorting NSTableView content.

Surprisingly I found that data editing in table does not function after sorting NSTableView. It behaves the same if this two lines will be commented out and sort will be done by clicking on table header columns. Before sorting editing is working as it should: Double clicking and just enter what you want to.
